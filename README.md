# SudokuSolver
C++ program that solves Sudoku

# How to use
this will be the sample sudoku puzzle:

![sudoku](https://github.com/EmilMis/SudokuSolver/blob/main/README-assets/samplein.png)

you will input it into the program like so:

![sudoku_input](https://github.com/EmilMis/SudokuSolver/blob/main/README-assets/programin.png)

basically every empty field will be -1, and other fields will be given numerical values as in the puzzle.

The program output will look like this

![sudoku_output](https://github.com/EmilMis/SudokuSolver/blob/main/README-assets/programout.png)

That's basically it, have fun
